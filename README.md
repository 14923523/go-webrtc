This repository is currently fluctuating a lot.
This currently only builds on linux, but OSX is in progress.
Actual documentation is on the way.

## Conventions

- Please run `go fmt` before every commit.

- There is a `.CGO()` method for every Go struct which expects being passed to
  native code.
